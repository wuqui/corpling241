	- “Data from eight historical corpora spanning the period between **1250 and 1871** are investigated with regard to occurrences of the ‘**N+BE+that-construction**’ (as in my concern is that [...], the idea was that [...]).
	  id:: 646c8707-eff6-415a-aeef-ecde49f26c76
	- The formal, semantic, and pragmatic changes of this construction are described on the basis of 1,588 attestations retrieved from the corpora.
	- Following this, the usage profiles of **individual authors** are examined. It is shown that even authors who are comparable in terms of period and genre show significant differences with regard to
		- the **frequency** of use of the construction,
		- **collocational** ranges and preferences,
		- the use of **semi-fixed lexical expressions** manifesting the construction,
		- as well as their **functional preferences**.
	- These differences are interpreted from the perspective of the so-called [‘ Entrenchment-and-Conventionalization Model’]([[EC-Model]]) (Schmid 2014a and 2015).
		- It is argued that the usage profiles of individual authors can provide insights into the ways in which the construction under investigation was represented in these authors’ minds,
		- and that the observable collective long-term changes arise from the interaction of the cognitive processes in individual minds and the social processes taking place in the speech community.”
