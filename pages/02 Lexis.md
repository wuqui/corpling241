	- cultural and linguistic innovation
	  collapsed:: true
		- society continually changes as new practices and products emerge (e.g. smartphones)
		- these changes typically first manifest themselves in language on the level of lexis in the form of [[neologisms]] (e.g. the words *smartphone* or *iphone*)
			- semantic neologisms: denotational vs connotational change
				- *hotspot*
				- de. *Querdenker*
				- *(social) distancing*
				- *spreader*
		- knowledge of words is [conventional]([[conventionalization]]): speakers learn form-meaning pairings (→ model of the linguistic Sign by Ferdinand de Saussure; e.g. *tree*)
	- [[theoretical framework]]
		- the [[S-curve model]] of [linguistic innovation]([[linguistic innovation]]), [[diffusion]], and [change]([[language change]])

			- the more frequently a word is used, the more likely it is
				- that speakers have stored it in their [[mental lexicon]] ([[entrenchment]])
				- that it is part of the conventional language system of a language ([[conventionalization]])

		- concordances
			- in the [[enTenTen20]] corpus
				- search for attestations of the word *smartphone*
				- search for attestations of the pattern `ADJ + SMARTPHONE` (i.e. the [lemmatized]([[lemmatization]]) [[word type]] , including *smartphones*)
				- search for attestations of the pattern `the NOUN BE that` as in *the thing is that* or *the problems are that*
		- [[frequency]] analysis
			- identify the most common adjectives in the pattern `ADJ SMARTPHONE` in the [[enTenTen20]] corpus
			- in the [[English Historical Book Collection (EEBO, ECCO, Evans)]] corpus
				- identify which words have exhibited the highest increase in usage frequency by using the `trends` feature
				- get an overview of the frequency increase of the word which has shown the most positive trend
