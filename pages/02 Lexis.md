		- cultural and linguistic innovation
		  collapsed:: true
			- society continually changes as new practices and products emerge (e.g. smartphones)
			- these changes typically first manifest themselves in language on the level of lexis in the form of [[neologisms]] (e.g. the words *smartphone* or *iphone*)
				- Which recent neologisms can you think of?

			- in the [[enTenTen20]] corpus
				- search for attestations of the word *smartphone*
				- search for attestations of the pattern `ADJ + SMARTPHONE` (i.e. the [lemmatized]([[lemmatization]]) [[word type]] , including *smartphones*)
				- search for attestations of the pattern `TAKE a LOOK at NOUN`
		- [[frequency]] analysis
		  collapsed:: true
			- in the [[enTenTen20]] corpus, identify the most common adjectives in the pattern `ADJ SMARTPHONE`
			- in the [[English Historical Book Collection (EEBO, ECCO, Evans)]] corpus
				- identify which words have exhibited the highest increase in usage frequency by using the `trends` feature
				- get an overview of the frequency increase of the word which has shown the most positive trend
