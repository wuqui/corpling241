This feature helps users manage complex information networks and maintain clarity as their knowledge base grows.
	- **block referencing**: Logseq allows users to reference individual blocks or sections of notes, which can then be embedded in other pages or notes. This feature encourages the reuse and interlinking of content, promoting a more efficient and flexible approach to knowledge management.
	- **backlinks and unlinked references**: Logseq automatically tracks and displays backlinks and unlinked references for each note. This helps users identify potential connections between notes and ensures that no valuable insights are overlooked.
	- **customizable workflow**: Logseq is highly customizable, enabling users to adapt the platform to their preferred note-taking and organization style. This flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from personal knowledge management to collaborative projects.
