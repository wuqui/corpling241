- This course covers theoretical and practical aspects of corpus linguistics, with an emphasis on hands-on learning. Students will examine language use in different domains, studying a range of linguistic concepts from domains such as lexis, morphology, and syntax, and investigate social variation, text type variation, and language change in these areas. The course will use data from different time periods and different genres (e.g. web corpora, academic prose, novels) to give students hands-on experience in analysing data and to cover a wide range of linguistic phenomena.
- Throughout the course, students will learn how to use various corpus linguistic methods such as queries, frequency analysis, collocations, and text type analysis. By using tools like Sketch Engine and Excel, students will gain hands-on experience analysing real-world data and gain a deeper understanding of how these methods can be applied in different linguistic contexts. For example, we will analyse differences in the usage of words and constructions over time using the Gutenberg corpus, we will use Sketch Engine to analyse meaning change and variation, and Excel to create frequency tables and charts.
- By the end of the course, students will be able to analyse corpus data using corpus linguistic methods and tools, and gain a deeper understanding of language use in different contexts.
