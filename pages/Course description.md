- This course delves into the theoretical and practical aspects of corpus linguistics, with an emphasis on hands-on learning. Students will examine language use in various domains, studying a range of linguistic concepts from domains such as lexis, morphology, and syntax, as well as examining social variation, text type variation, and language change. The course will utilize real-life data sources such as the BNC2014 spoken corpus, web corpora, and social media platforms like Twitter to provide students with hands-on experience analyzing data.
- Throughout the course, students will learn how to use various corpus linguistic methods such as queries, frequency analysis, collocations, and text type analysis. By using tools like Sketch Engine and Excel, students will gain hands-on experience analyzing real-world data and gain a deeper understanding of how these methods can be applied in different linguistic contexts.
- For example, we will analyze differences in the usage of words and constructions over time using the EEBO corpus, we will use Sketch Engine to perform collocation analysis, and Excel to create frequency tables and charts to gain a better understanding of the language usage in a specific text type or context.
- By the end of the course, students will be able to analyze real-world data using corpus linguistic methods and tools, and gain a deeper understanding of language use in different contexts.
