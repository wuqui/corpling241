- This course covers theoretical and practical aspects of corpus linguistics, with an emphasis on hands-on learning. Students will examine language use in different domains, studying a range of linguistic concepts from domains such as [lexis]([[lexis]]), [morphology]([[morphology]]), and [syntax]([[syntax]]), and investigate [variation]([[linguistic variation]]) and [language change]([[language change]]) in these areas. The course will use data from different time periods and different genres (e.g. web corpora, academic prose, novels) to give students hands-on experience in analysing data and to cover a wide range of linguistic phenomena.

- Throughout the course, students will learn how to use various corpus linguistic methods such as queries, [frequency]([[frequency]]) analysis, [collocations]([[collocations]]), and [text type analysis]([[text type/variation]]). By using tools like [Sketch Engine]([[Sketch Engine]]) and [Excel]([[Microsoft Excel]]), students will gain hands-on experience analysing real-world data and gain a deeper understanding of how these methods can be applied in different linguistic contexts. For example, we will analyse differences in the usage of words and constructions over time using the [Gutenberg corpus]([[Gutenberg Project]]), we will use Sketch Engine to analyse [meaning change]([[semantic/change]]) and [variation]([[semantic/variation]]), and Excel to create frequency tables and charts.
- By the end of the course, students will be able to analyse corpus data using corpus linguistic methods and tools, and gain a deeper understanding of language use in different contexts.
