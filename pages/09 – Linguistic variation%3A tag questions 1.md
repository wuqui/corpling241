			- This type of tag question consists of two clauses,
				- an anchor
				- and a tag.
			- The **subject**
				- in the anchor can be
					- a full noun phrase,
					- a pronoun,
					- or *there*,
				- but in the tag, it must be either
					- a personal pronoun,
					- *there*, or
					- *one*.
			- The **verb**
				- in the anchor can be
					- a lexical verb,
					- an auxiliary,
					- or a modal verb;
				- the verb in the tag must be
					- an auxiliary
					- or a modal.
		- polarity
		  collapsed:: true
			- There can be **reversed polarity** (positive–negative or negative–positive) in the anchor clause and the following question tag, as in (1) and (2);
			- **constant positive polarity**, as in (3);
			- or **constant negative polarity**, as in (4), a rare type whose existence has occasionally been questioned (see e.g., Quirk et al. 1985, 813) but of which we have found some genuine examples.”
	- constraints
	  collapsed:: true
		- preceding *wh*-words
		  collapsed:: true
			- “One constraint was to disallow instances with a wh-word (or a wh-word followed by a noun) immediately preceding the potential tag as in (6) and (7):
				- (6) Hello, how are you? (BNC-S)
				- (7) What number is it? (BNC-S)”
		- subsequent verbs
		  collapsed:: true
			- “Another constraint excluded sentences with a verb immediately following the pronoun, as in (8) and (9):
				- (8) Doesn’t he like the vet? (BNC-S)
				- (9) Hasn’t he improved? (BNC-S)”
		- subsequent adjectives
		  collapsed:: true
			- “A third constraint excluded examples containing an adjective immediately following the pronoun of the potential question tag, as in (10) and (11):
				- (10) Are they comfortable? (BNC-S)
				- (11) Are you happy to do it...?(BNC-S)”
	- random sample
	  collapsed:: true
		- “We therefore worked with a random subset of these, which yielded a total of 4,973 relevant instances. Frequency figures for BNC-S are therefore based on extrapolation rather than full manual counts. However, given the high number of relevant instances, we are confident that our results are valid.”

		- polarity
			- Based on two samples of 1,000 instances each, we found that positive–negative polarity tag constructions are indeed the most frequent choice in both varieties, accounting for 75 percent of the totals in British and 69 percent in American English.” (p. 289)

				- “It seems highly probable that what we see here is not a development toward fewer tags in younger people but a shift in the type of tags used by different age groups, a hypothesis that is at least partially supported by a preliminary study of British English by Serino (2006).” (p. 306)
- [[practice]]: study question tags in the [BNC 2014 Spoken]([[BNC/2014/spoken]]) using [[Sketch Engine]]
	- shared [[Microsoft Excel]] sheet: https://1drv.ms/x/s!AvkgNVl9yS6aokXQ2KHBstYsWunQ
	- retrieve attestations of question tags
	  id:: 66743b58-d38d-44b2-afb1-2ec6ae992520
		- create and refine a query to collect question tags
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1718917111793_0.png)
			- `[tag="MD" | lemma="be" | lemma="do" | lemma="have"] [word="n't"]?  [tag="PP.?"] [word="\?"]`
			- https://ske.li/questiontagsbnc
		- evaluate false positive rate
			- use [[Sketch Engine]] download a [[random sample]] of 50 hits
			- use [[Microsoft Excel]] to annotate and analyse it
				- model sheet: https://1drv.ms/x/s!AvkgNVl9yS6aokmqDbTz5BmfbU6C
				- add a column named `Label`
				- annotate each attestation with
					- `0`: no question tag → false positive
					- `1`: question tag → true positive
				- think about how you could reduce false positives
					- either in SkE by refining your query
						- exclude instancest at utterances start
							- ```
							  <u> []{1,} 1:[tag="MD" | lemma="be" | lemma="do" | lemma="have"] [word="n't"]? [tag="PP.?"] [word="\?"] within <u/>
							  ```
						- exclude *wh*-words preceding the pattern (like *when* and *where*)
							- ```
							  <u> []{1,} [lemma!="where|who|which|when"] [tag="MD" | lemma="be" | lemma="do" | lemma="have"] [word="n't"]?  [tag="PP.?"] [word="\?"]  within <u/>
							  ```
					- or in Excel using filters (see model sheet)
