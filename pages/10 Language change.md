					- **Definition**: The coefficient of variation (CV) is a statistical measure that describes the relative variability of data. It is calculated as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, and is often expressed as a percentage. This measure is particularly useful when comparing the degree of variation from one data series to another, even if the means are drastically different from each other.
					- **Application**: In the context of corpus linguistics, the CV can be used to measure the variability of word frequencies across different texts or corpora.
					- **Mathematical Formula**
						- CV = (Standard Deviation / Mean)
						- $$ CV = \left( \frac{\sigma}{\mu} \right) $$
					- **Calculation in Excel**
						- 1. **Calculate the Mean**: Use the `AVERAGE` function in Excel to calculate the mean of your data. If your data is in cells A1 to A10, you would type `=AVERAGE(A1:A10)` in a new cell.
						- 2. **Calculate the Standard Deviation**: Use the `STDEV.P` function (for a whole population) or the `STDEV.S` function (for a sample) in Excel to calculate the standard deviation. If your data is in cells A1 to A10, you would type `=STDEV.P(A1:A10)` or `=STDEV.S(A1:A10)` in a new cell.
						- 3. **Calculate the Coefficient of Variation**: Divide the standard deviation by the mean and multiply by 100 to get the coefficient of variation. If your mean is in cell B1 and your standard deviation is in cell B2, you would type `=(B2/B1)*100` in a new cell.
